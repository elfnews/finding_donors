# Finding Donors for Chariy ML

Charity ML, a fictional charity organization, is need of donors. Here we try to help them find potential donors. We use the census data to identify individuals making more than $50K per annum. A letter will be sent to the identified individuals requesting for donations.

We start with a baseline "naive" accuracy and fbeta_score metrics. We pick three prediction models and pick one based on various metrics & training time. We also try to improve the hyperparameters for the identified model.
